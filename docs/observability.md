# Observability Guide

Enzyme has built-in OpenTelemetry (OTel) instrumentation for traces and metrics. When enabled, telemetry data is exported via OTLP to any compatible backend — Datadog, Honeycomb, HyperDX, Grafana Cloud, etc. Disabled by default with zero overhead.

This guide covers what Enzyme captures, how to set it up, and how to add system-level metrics with an OTel Collector.

## Quick Start

Enable telemetry with a single environment variable:

```bash
ENZYME_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true ./enzyme
```

Or in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: 'localhost:4317'
  protocol: 'grpc'
  sample_rate: 1.0
  service_name: 'enzyme'
```

Enzyme pushes data to the configured OTLP endpoint. You need a collector or backend listening there to receive it. See [Setup Examples](#setup-examples) below.

## Configuration

## What's Captured

### Traces

Traces show the lifecycle of a request from start to finish. Each trace is a tree of **spans** representing operations.

#### HTTP Request Spans

Every incoming HTTP request creates a root span with:

- **Span name**: `METHOD /route/pattern` (e.g., `GET /api/workspaces/{wid}/channels`)
- **Attributes**: HTTP method, status code, route pattern, response size, user agent
- **Duration**: Total request processing time

The span name uses the route pattern (not the raw URL), so `/api/workspaces/01J5X.../channels` appears as `/api/workspaces/{wid}/channels`. This keeps span cardinality manageable.

#### Database Spans

Key database operations create child spans under the HTTP request span. These help identify slow queries:

| Span Name                  | Operation                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `message.Create`           | Insert a new message (transaction)              |
| `message.List`             | List messages in a channel (paginated)          |
| `message.Search`           | Full-text search across workspace messages      |
| `channel.GetByID`          | Fetch a single channel                          |
| `channel.ListForWorkspace` | List all channels with membership info (JOIN)   |
| `workspace.GetMembership`  | Check user's membership and role in a workspace |

All database spans include the `db.system: sqlite` attribute.

#### Trace Context Propagation

When frontend telemetry is enabled, the browser injects a W3C `traceparent` header into API requests. The backend extracts this header and creates child spans under the frontend's trace, giving you end-to-end visibility from button click to database query.

The CORS configuration automatically allows `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers when telemetry is enabled.

### Metrics

Metrics are exported every 60 seconds via OTLP.

| Metric                   | Type          | Attributes | Description                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `sse.connections.active` | UpDownCounter | —          | Current number of active SSE connections |
| `sse.events.broadcast`   | Counter       | `scope`    | Total SSE events broadcast               |

**`sse.events.broadcast` attributes:**

- `scope`: `workspace` (broadcast to all members), `channel` (broadcast to channel members only), or `user` (targeted to a single user)

### Log Correlation

When telemetry is enabled, every log line is enriched with `trace_id` and `span_id` fields from the active request context. This lets you jump from a log entry directly to the corresponding trace in your observability backend.

Example log output with telemetry enabled (JSON format):

```json
{
  "time": "2026-02-27T10:15:30Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "msg": "request completed",
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/api/workspaces/01J5X/channels/01J6Y/messages",
  "status": 200,
  "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
  "span_id": "00f067aa0ba902b7"
}
```

Text format also includes the fields:

```
time=2026-02-27T10:15:30Z level=INFO msg="request completed" method=POST path=... trace_id=4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736 span_id=00f067aa0ba902b7
```

### Resource Attributes

Every trace and metric is tagged with resource attributes that identify the Enzyme instance:

| Attribute         | Value                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `service.name`    | Configured `service_name` (default: `enzyme`) |
| `service.version` | Server version (from build, e.g., `0.1.0`)    |
| `host.name`       | Hostname of the machine                       |
| `os.type`         | Operating system (e.g., `linux`, `darwin`)    |

---

## Frontend Telemetry

The web client has separate telemetry for browser-side fetch calls and page loads, with trace context propagation to the backend.

### Enabling

Frontend telemetry activates automatically when the Go server serves the embedded web client with `telemetry.enabled` and `telemetry.traces` both set to `true` (the defaults when telemetry is enabled). No build-time configuration or environment variables are needed.

The server injects a `window.__ENZYME_CONFIG__` script into `index.html` at runtime, telling the frontend to load the OTel SDK. The Go server also proxies `/api/telemetry/traces` to the configured OTLP collector, so no reverse proxy setup is needed. Self-hosters who download the pre-built binary get frontend telemetry without rebuilding the web client.

**For development without the Go server** (e.g., `pnpm --filter @enzyme/web dev` against a separate API), use the build-time env var as a fallback:

```bash
VITE_OTEL_ENABLED=true VITE_OTEL_ENDPOINT=/api/telemetry/traces pnpm --filter @enzyme/web dev
```

| Env Var              | Default                 | Description                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_OTEL_ENABLED`  | not set                 | Dev-only fallback. Set to `"true"` to enable telemetry. |
| `VITE_OTEL_ENDPOINT` | `/api/telemetry/traces` | Dev-only fallback. OTLP HTTP endpoint for trace export. |

### What's Instrumented

- **Fetch calls**: Every `fetch()` request creates a span with URL, method, status, and duration. Since the `@enzyme/api-client` uses native `fetch`, all API calls are automatically covered.
- **Page loads**: Document load timing (DNS, TCP, TLS, TTFB, DOM content loaded, load complete).
- **Unhandled errors**: Uncaught exceptions (`error.unhandled`) and unhandled promise rejections (`error.unhandled_rejection`) are captured as error spans with `exception.type`, `exception.message`, and `exception.stacktrace` attributes.
- **Trace propagation**: W3C `traceparent` header is injected into requests to same-origin and the configured API base URL. Third-party requests are not affected.

### How It Works

Frontend telemetry is **lazy-loaded** — the OTel SDK is only imported when the runtime config or `VITE_OTEL_ENABLED` enables it. The telemetry chunk is included in the production bundle but only fetched by the browser when telemetry is active.

The frontend reports as service name `enzyme-web`, separate from the backend's `enzyme` service. In your observability backend, you'll see traces that start in `enzyme-web` and continue into `enzyme` via the propagated trace context.

### Collector Routing

The frontend exports traces over OTLP/HTTP (not gRPC, since browsers can't speak gRPC) to `/api/telemetry/traces`. The Go server includes a built-in reverse proxy that forwards these requests to the collector's OTLP/HTTP receiver:

- **HTTP protocol** (`telemetry.protocol: http`): forwards to the configured `telemetry.endpoint`
- **gRPC on port 4317** (local collector default): swaps to port `4318` (the standard OTLP/HTTP port)
- **gRPC on any other port** (cloud providers like Honeycomb, Grafana Cloud): uses the same endpoint, since these providers serve both gRPC and HTTP on the same port

To override the auto-derived endpoint, set `telemetry.frontend_endpoint`:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: api.honeycomb.io:443
  protocol: grpc
  frontend_endpoint: collector.internal:4318 # explicit override
```

The proxy also forwards any `telemetry.headers` to the collector for authentication (e.g., Honeycomb API keys).

## Sampling

For high-traffic deployments, trace sampling reduces data volume without losing visibility. The `sample_rate` setting controls what fraction of traces are captured:

| Value | Effect                                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `1.0` | Sample everything (default). Good for development and low-traffic. |
| `0.5` | Sample 50% of traces. Good balance for moderate traffic.           |
| `0.1` | Sample 10%. Suitable for high-traffic production.                  |
| `0.0` | Disable tracing entirely. Metrics are still exported.              |

Sampling is **parent-based**: if an incoming request already has a `traceparent` header with a sampling decision, Enzyme respects it. This ensures that frontend-initiated traces are complete even at low sample rates.

## Graceful Shutdown

When Enzyme receives SIGINT or SIGTERM, it flushes all pending traces and metrics to the collector before shutting down. The flush happens within the 30-second shutdown timeout. No data is lost during normal restarts or deployments.

## Performance Impact

When telemetry is **disabled** (the default), there is zero overhead — no providers are initialized, no metrics are recorded, and no spans are created.

When **enabled**, the overhead is minimal:

- HTTP middleware adds ~1-2 microseconds per request for span creation
- Database spans add ~0.5 microseconds per instrumented operation
- SSE metrics use atomic counter operations (negligible cost)
- Traces are batched and exported asynchronously in the background
- Metrics are collected and exported every 60 seconds

For most deployments, telemetry overhead is unmeasurable relative to actual request processing time.

## Setup Examples

Enzyme exports standard OTLP, so it works with any backend that accepts OTLP. Below are examples for common platforms.

### Datadog

The Datadog Agent runs alongside Enzyme and accepts OTLP locally, then forwards to Datadog. No API key header is needed from Enzyme — the agent holds the key.

Enable the OTLP receiver in your Datadog Agent config:

```yaml
# datadog.yaml
otlp_config:
  receiver:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
```

Then point Enzyme at the agent:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: 'localhost:4317'
```

If the agent runs on a different host (e.g., a sidecar in Kubernetes), replace `localhost` with the agent's address.

### Honeycomb

Honeycomb accepts OTLP directly — no collector or agent needed. Authentication uses the `x-honeycomb-team` header with your API key.

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: 'api.honeycomb.io:443'
  protocol: 'grpc'
  insecure: false
  headers:
    x-honeycomb-team: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

For EU region, use `api.eu1.honeycomb.io:443` instead.

### HyperDX

HyperDX accepts OTLP directly. Authentication uses the `authorization` header with your ingestion API key (found under Team Settings in HyperDX).

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: 'in-otel.hyperdx.io:4317'
  protocol: 'grpc'
  insecure: false
  headers:
    authorization: 'YOUR_HYPERDX_API_KEY'
```

### Other Backends

Any OTLP-compatible backend (Axiom, Grafana Cloud, New Relic, etc.) works the same way: set `telemetry.endpoint` to their OTLP receiver, `telemetry.protocol` to `grpc` or `http`, and pass any required auth headers via `telemetry.headers`.

### Adding System Metrics with a Collector

The examples above (except Datadog) send OTLP directly from Enzyme to the backend. This covers Enzyme's own traces and metrics, but not system-level metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.

To get system metrics, run an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) alongside Enzyme with the [Host Metrics receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver) enabled. Point Enzyme at the collector instead of the backend, and have the collector forward everything upstream.

```yaml
# otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 30s
    scrapers:
      cpu:
      memory:
      disk:
      network:

exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: https://api.honeycomb.io
    headers:
      x-honeycomb-team: 'YOUR_API_KEY'

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, hostmetrics]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

Then point Enzyme at the collector:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: 'localhost:4317'
```

The Datadog Agent already works this way — it acts as a collector that gathers both OTLP data and system metrics.
