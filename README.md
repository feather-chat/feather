## Why Enzyme?

Enzyme is fully open-source (not just open-core), self-hostable, and designed to feel familiar to anyone who's used Slack. You own your data, you own your instance, and the license guarantees that won't change.

For a detailed comparison with other options, see [Alternatives](https://enzyme.im/comparisons/alternatives/).

## Quick Start

Download the latest release and run it — that's it.

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/enzyme/enzyme/releases/latest/download/enzyme-linux-amd64
chmod +x enzyme-linux-amd64
./enzyme-linux-amd64
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8080` and serves both the API and web client. See the [self-hosting guide](https://enzyme.im/docs/self-hosting/) for production deployment with TLS and systemd.

## Configuration

Enzyme is configured via config file, environment variables, or CLI flags. See the [configuration guide](https://enzyme.im/docs/configuration/) for all available options.
