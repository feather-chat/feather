# Feather

A self-hostable Slack alternative built with Go and React.

## Features

- **Workspaces** - Create teams with role-based permissions (owner, admin, member, guest)
- **Channels** - Public, private, DM, and group DM conversations
- **Messages** - Rich messaging with flat threading (Slack-style) and emoji reactions
- **Real-time** - Server-Sent Events (SSE) with automatic reconnection
- **Presence** - Online/away/offline status with typing indicators
- **File Uploads** - Multipart uploads with configurable storage

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Start development servers
make dev
```

This starts:

- **API** at http://localhost:8080
- **Web** at http://localhost:3000

## Commands

| Command               | Description                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `make dev`            | Start API and web dev servers |
| `make build`          | Build all packages            |
| `make test`           | Run all tests                 |
| `make generate-types` | Regenerate types from OpenAPI |
| `make lint`           | Lint all code                 |

## Type Sharing

Types are generated from `api/openapi.yaml` and shared via the `@feather/api-client` package:

```bash
# Regenerate after API changes
make generate-types
```

## CI/CD

### Continuous Integration

CI runs automatically on every push to `main` and on pull requests:

- Linting (Go vet, ESLint)
- Tests (Go tests)
- Type checking (TypeScript)
- Build verification

### Releases

Releases are triggered manually by pushing a version tag:

```bash
# Create and push a release tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This builds binaries for 6 platforms and creates a GitHub Release with:

- `feather-linux-amd64`, `feather-linux-arm64`
- `feather-darwin-amd64`, `feather-darwin-arm64`
- `feather-windows-amd64.exe`, `feather-windows-arm64.exe`
- `feather-web.tar.gz` (frontend bundle)
