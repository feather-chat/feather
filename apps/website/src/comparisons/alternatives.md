# Alternatives

Enzyme isn't the first open-source chat app, and you might be wondering how it compares to the alternatives. This page tries to be fair about the landscape — what each option does well, where the tradeoffs are, and where Enzyme fits.

## Mattermost

Mattermost is the most mature open-source Slack alternative. It has a polished UI, a large feature set, and years of production hardening at serious organizations. If your team needs enterprise features like SAML/LDAP authentication, compliance exports, or granular admin controls, Mattermost has them and they work well. The plugin ecosystem is extensive, the mobile apps are solid, and there's a large community behind it.

The concern is trajectory. Mattermost has raised over $70M in venture capital, and the self-hosting story has gotten worse over time, not better. They introduced a 10,000 message history limit on self-hosted instances — you host the server, store the data, and still can't access your own messages past that limit. Key features are increasingly gated behind proprietary licenses.

It comes down to maturity vs. trust. Mattermost has more features, more integrations, and a longer track record. But its licensing is increasingly complex, and the VC-funded trajectory gives reasonable cause to wonder what the self-hosted experience will look like in a few years. Enzyme is MIT-licensed, has no proprietary tiers, and no investor pressure to create them. It's a younger product with a smaller feature set, but what you get today won't be taken away tomorrow.

## Rocket.Chat

Rocket.Chat is one of the most feature-rich open-source communication platforms available. It covers chat, omnichannel customer support, and helpdesk in a single product. If your organization needs all of those things, having them integrated is a real advantage over running separate tools. Rocket.Chat also has strong internationalization support, a marketplace for apps and integrations, and an active development community.

The breadth comes at a cost. The UI has a lot of surface area, which can feel overwhelming if you just need chat. Self-hosting requires MongoDB, which is operationally heavier than simpler database options. And like Mattermost, Rocket.Chat has taken significant venture funding, with meaningful features now gated behind proprietary tiers.

Enzyme is focused on chat — no omnichannel, no helpdesk. If your organization needs those capabilities, Rocket.Chat is worth serious consideration. If chat is all you need, the question is whether you want the breadth of a VC-funded platform or the long-term simplicity of an MIT-licensed tool.

## Zulip

Zulip is open source, community-driven, and one of the most thoughtfully designed chat tools available. Its standout feature is a threading model where every message belongs to a "topic" within a channel, creating a two-level hierarchy. For groups that do a lot of asynchronous communication — distributed teams across time zones, open-source projects, academic groups — this model is superior to Slack-style chat. It makes it easy to catch up on specific discussions without wading through interleaved conversations, and it keeps channels organized in a way that flat message lists can't match. Zulip also has excellent search, a good API, and a strong track record of sustainable open-source development.

The threading model is polarizing, though. It requires discipline — every message needs a topic, and the UX nudges you toward that structure. People who want casual, free-flowing chat often find it adds friction. It's a real design tradeoff: better organization at the cost of more structure.

On the self-hosting side, Zulip requires PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, and memcached. Their installer handles the setup well, but it's a full stack to maintain and update.

Enzyme and Zulip share a lot of values: both are fully open source, both prioritize the self-hosted experience, and neither is trying to funnel you toward a paid cloud tier. The difference is UX philosophy. Zulip bets that added structure is worth the learning curve. Enzyme bets that most people want something that feels like Slack from day one, with no adoption friction. If Zulip's model clicks for your group, it's an excellent choice — the closest thing to Enzyme in spirit, just with a different UX bet.

## Campfire (37signals)

Campfire is 37signals' MIT-licensed group chat tool. It has the core features — rooms, direct messages, mentions, search, file sharing — and ships as a Docker container you can deploy on your own hardware or any cloud provider. It also works on air-gapped networks, which is a real advantage for organizations with strict security requirements.

The UI is clean and opinionated, but unconventional compared to Slack and Discord. If your group is used to a sidebar with channels, a message list, and a thread panel, Campfire will feel different — it takes a more minimal approach that not everyone will find intuitive. Campfire also doesn't have threads, which is a deliberate design choice but a dealbreaker for some.

Campfire and Enzyme are close in philosophy — both are MIT-licensed, self-hostable, and designed to do chat well without trying to be a platform. The main difference is UX: Enzyme follows a conventional Slack-style layout, while Campfire charts its own path.

## Element / Matrix

Element is the flagship client for the Matrix protocol, a federated communication standard. Matrix has real, unique strengths: end-to-end encryption is built into the protocol (not bolted on), federation means no single entity controls the network, and the ecosystem supports not just text chat but voice, video, and bridging to other platforms. If your threat model requires E2EE by default, or if you need to communicate across organizational boundaries without depending on a shared third-party service, Matrix is one of the few options that actually delivers on that.

Federation comes with real costs, though. It adds complexity to both the software and the user experience. Concepts like homeservers, identity servers, and room state resolution exist for good reasons, but they're confusing for people who just want to chat. Self-hosting a Matrix server involves configuring federation, managing DNS, and running a database — even if you have no interest in federating. And federation introduces content moderation challenges, since content from other servers can appear on your instance.

Enzyme does not federate and does not offer end-to-end encryption. That makes for a simpler, more predictable experience, but it means Enzyme isn't the right choice if E2EE or cross-organization federation are requirements. If those matter, Matrix is worth the added complexity. If they don't, Enzyme offers a more familiar interface with less conceptual overhead.

## XMPP (Conversations, Dino, Snikket, etc.)

XMPP is one of the most enduring open protocols in computing. It's been around for over 25 years, is standardized through the IETF, and has a devoted community. The protocol is deeply extensible — the XEP process means new capabilities can be added without breaking existing implementations. XMPP also offers real client choice: you can pick the client that fits your platform and preferences, and you're never locked into a single vendor's software. Projects like Snikket have made significant progress packaging XMPP into a turnkey self-hosted solution with a consistent experience.

The cost of that openness is consistency. Because XMPP is a protocol with many independent implementations, features like read receipts, typing indicators, reactions, and file sharing depend on which extensions each client supports. The experience varies depending on which client each person uses. And the Slack-style model of workspaces with channels, threads, and role-based permissions was designed through extensions (MUC, then MIX) rather than being native to the protocol, so that particular UX paradigm takes more effort to achieve.

Enzyme is a product rather than a protocol — one server, one client, designed together. That means a consistent, familiar experience out of the box, but it also means less choice and no interoperability with other systems. If protocol openness and client diversity matter more to you than a unified product experience, XMPP is the more principled choice.

## Stoat (formerly Revolt)

Stoat is an open-source Discord alternative with a polished UI and active development. It supports voice channels, custom bots, friend requests, and a community-oriented social model. If your use case is an open or semi-public community — an open-source project, a gaming group, a creator community — Stoat does a good job of providing the Discord experience without the proprietary platform.

Stoat and Enzyme overlap but have different roots. Stoat leans into the Discord model with voice channels, friend requests, and a social layer. Enzyme follows the Slack model with channels, threads, and workspace roles. If the Discord-style experience is what your community wants, Stoat is a good fit.

## Discourse

Discourse is excellent forum software — arguably the best open-source option available. Its chat feature has matured significantly and integrates well with the forum, creating a workflow where quick conversations can happen in chat and longer discussions live in topics. If your communication naturally splits between real-time chat and long-form, searchable discussion, the combination is powerful and no other tool does it as well.

Discourse chat is a complement to the forum, though, not a standalone communication tool. If you primarily need real-time chat with channels and threads, Discourse's chat alone won't get you there. But if you'd benefit from both a forum and a chat tool, Discourse covers both in one product — a real advantage over running two separate systems.

## IRC

IRC has been around since 1988 and is still actively used, particularly in open-source and technical communities. It's simple, lightweight, fully decentralized, and has near-zero resource requirements. The protocol is so minimal that clients exist for virtually every platform, and a server can run on almost anything. For communities that value ephemerality, low overhead, and direct communication without bells and whistles, IRC remains a solid choice. Modern networks like Libera.Chat are well-run and reliable.

The gaps show up when you need persistence. IRC has no built-in message history — if you're not connected, you miss messages. Bouncers like ZNC or hosted services like IRCCloud solve this, but they add complexity. There's no native file sharing, reactions, threads, or rich formatting. Authentication is handled through services like NickServ rather than being part of the protocol itself.

Enzyme and IRC are almost philosophical opposites. IRC is a minimal protocol that trusts users to bring their own tooling; Enzyme is an integrated product that provides a familiar Slack-style experience out of the box. If you value minimalism and are comfortable assembling your own stack, IRC might be all you need.

## Slack

Slack defined the modern chat category and it's still the benchmark for UX. It's polished, reliable, and has an integration ecosystem that no open-source project comes close to matching. The search is good, the onboarding is smooth, and the API is well-documented. For many organizations, Slack just works — and that's a genuine strength that shouldn't be dismissed.

The case for an alternative comes down to control and cost. Slack is proprietary — you can't self-host, you can't inspect the source, and your data lives on Salesforce's servers. The free tier limits message history to 90 days, which means your knowledge base slowly disappears unless you pay. And the paid tiers are expensive: Pro is $8.75/user/month, Business+ is $15/user/month. For a 50-person organization, that's $5,250 to $9,000 per year.

There's also platform risk. Slack has changed its pricing model before and will again. Features get moved between tiers. APIs get deprecated. When you build your communication on a proprietary platform, you're subject to decisions made in Salesforce's interest, not yours.

Enzyme exists because Slack's UX is good but its ownership model isn't. The interface is deliberately familiar — channels, threads, reactions, file sharing — but MIT-licensed, self-hosted, with no per-seat fees and no disappearing history.

## Discord

Discord is a dominant platform for gaming and public communities. It's free, feature-rich, and handles voice and video better than any open-source alternative. The UX is fast, the bot ecosystem is massive, and for the use cases it's designed for — gaming communities, creator audiences, social groups — it's excellent. Some organizations have adopted it for work communication too, especially in tech and gaming-adjacent industries.

The concerns are ownership and portability. Discord isn't self-hostable, its business model depends on user engagement and data collection, and there's no meaningful way to export your data. If you decide to leave, your message history stays behind. For groups that want control over their infrastructure and data, that's the core issue.

Enzyme doesn't try to replace Discord's community and social features. It follows the Slack model — channels, threads, workspace roles — rather than the Discord model of servers, voice channels, and friend lists. If Slack-style chat with full data ownership is what you're after, that's the gap Enzyme fills.

## Other proprietary platforms (Teams, Google Chat, etc.)

Microsoft Teams and Google Chat are the other major proprietary options. They're typically adopted not on their own merits but because they're bundled with Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace — and when the chat tool is "free" with a suite you already pay for, the economic argument for anything else is hard to make. Teams also has strong video conferencing and deep integration with Office apps. Google Chat integrates tightly with Google Docs and Drive. If your organization lives in one of these ecosystems, the bundled chat tool has real workflow advantages.

The bundling is also the limitation. Teams and Google Chat reflect the priorities of their parent ecosystems, not the priorities of a standalone chat tool. Teams is tightly coupled to SharePoint and the Microsoft 365 graph, which adds complexity. Google Chat has been through multiple rebrands and product pivots (Hangouts, Hangouts Chat, Google Chat) and it's never clear how committed Google is to it long-term. Neither is self-hostable, and your data lives on Microsoft or Google infrastructure — subject to their data processing terms, their compliance frameworks, and their jurisdiction.

If you're already deep in one of these ecosystems and self-hosting isn't a priority, the bundled option is pragmatic. Enzyme is for organizations that want their chat tool to be independent — not tied to a platform vendor's suite and not subject to bundling decisions.
